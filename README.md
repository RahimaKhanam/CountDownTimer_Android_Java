# CountDownTimer_Android_Java

A countdown timer is pretty cool and fun to build as well as quite challenging to implement. We first have to get the timer running, and then, have to properly format the time, which is usually given in form of milliseconds. Transforming milliseconds into seconds and minutes without accidentally counting anything twice can easily take a few hours to figure out. 

So, I have created this project referring to the link: http://www.androidtutorialshub.com/android-count-down-timer-tutorial/

### This is how my App looks like:

This is when the app is launched:

This is when the timer is started:

This is when we pause the timer:

### This is the a small snippet of how the App behaves:
